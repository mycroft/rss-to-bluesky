# rss-to-bluesky

I'll be honest with you: I need to refactor a lot of things in this tool. But it works!

You can find it live on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/lobsters-feed.bsky.social).

## Build & run

```sh
$ go build ./cmd/rss-to-bluesky/
$ export BLUESKY_USERNAME="..."
$ export BLUESKY_PASSWORD="..."
$ ./rss-to-bluesky
```
